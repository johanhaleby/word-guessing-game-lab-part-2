# Getting Started
           
This is the second part of the Word Guessing Game Lab. In this exercise we're going to apply the Occurrent library to our "domain model". 
The domain is located in the "domain" package (feel free to move things around as you find fit). The purpose it to implement the workflow(s) that we agreed
upon in the event modeling session.
